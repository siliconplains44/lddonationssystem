# lddonationssystem

Welcome to my donations system project.

What is this project?

This is an asp.net core web application built for poverty alleviation.  The idea behind this web application is to give donors and clients the ability to connect over the web to make the process of giving Christmas gifts and Back to School help more efficient.

What are the technologies demoed in this project?

* asp.net core mvc 2.2
* C#
* Javascript
* Minimal single page application framework from Leopard Data
* Ado.net in .net core libraries
* MySQL
* data access code generation capability
* Jquery
* SQL
* JSON
* AJAJ (Asynchronous Javascript and Json)
* Simplified REST 
* Nginx

How do I get this code up and running?

* clone the repo
* open the solution (*.sln) in Visual Studio 2017, 2019 for mac or windows, or Visual Studio Code
* set your configuration files settings (you will need mysql and a database connection string)

After you load the solution and your configs you have 2 main projects to run...

* The ldnetcorerestapitodbgen (for generation of your rest api and data access layer)
* The ldnetcorespavdb web application (the primary web application)

How can I just see this code in action without setup?

This is a creation of allan@leoparddata.com.  If you would like to have a full demo of the working system just email me and I will give you a live demo.
