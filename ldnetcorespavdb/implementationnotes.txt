Overview

This document has been written to document some of the assumptions that went into
designing and developing this solution.  

User Accounts, Individuals, Donors, Clients, and Administrators

The 3 main account types in the system is administrator, client, and donor.
A client is in need of services, a donor is something that provides service
resources, and an administrator manages the system.  

Within the database schema we have tables for donor, client, and admins.  Each
table is designed to hold their respective information.  When we create user
accounts we do not create records in the admins, clients, and donors table.  

The system allows sign up a couple different ways.  You can sign up from the
registration page, or an admin can create other admins, donors, or clients.
Clients can be created with or without a user account.  Some clients are the 
kids of the families that need service resources and they won't need an account
on the site.  Donors are created and always associated with a user account.
Admins are also always associated with a user account.  

The only way administrators can be created is from within the web application.  
Only an existing administrator may create and manage all other administrators.
